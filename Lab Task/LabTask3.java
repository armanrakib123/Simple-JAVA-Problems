//Create a base class Shape that has an abstract method calculateArea() which will be implemented by subclasses to calculate
//the area of different shapes. Then, create two subclasses: Rectangle and Circle and also make sure that these 2 classes can not be extended furthermore.
//The Rectangle class should have instance variables length and width and implement calculateArea() to return length * width.
//The Circle class should have an instance variable radius and implement calculateArea() to return Ï€ * radius * radius.
//In the main method, create objects of both Rectangle and Circle, initialize their dimensions, and call calculateArea() to display their respective areas.
